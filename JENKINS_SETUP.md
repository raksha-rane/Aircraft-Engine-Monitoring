# Pre-Jenkins Setup Checklist ✅

This document outlines what has been prepared for Jenkins integration and what you need to do next.

## ✅ **Completed Setup Tasks**

### **1. Testing Infrastructure**
- ✅ Created `tests/` directory with comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Unit tests for data simulator (`tests/test_data_simulator.py`)
- ✅ Unit tests for ML models (`tests/test_ml_models.py`)
- ✅ Integration tests (`tests/test_integration.py`)
- ✅ pytest configuration (`pytest.ini`)

### **2. Configuration Management**
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration (`src/config.py`)
- ✅ Separate configs for dev/test/staging/production
- ✅ Environment variable support

### **3. Health Monitoring**
- ✅ Comprehensive health check script (`scripts/health_check.py`)
- ✅ Checks Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, ML models, Streamlit
- ✅ Returns proper exit codes for CI/CD

### **4. Docker Environment**
- ✅ Separate test environment (`docker-compose.test.yml`)
- ✅ Isolated test databases and services
- ✅ Different ports to avoid conflicts

### **5. Build Automation**
- ✅ Comprehensive Makefile with all common tasks
- ✅ Commands for testing, linting, Docker management
- ✅ CI/CD helper commands

### **6. Jenkins Pipeline**
- ✅ Complete Jenkinsfile with all stages
- ✅ Parallel test execution
- ✅ Environment-specific deployments
- ✅ Proper cleanup and reporting

### **7. Code Quality Tools**
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with testing tools
- ✅ Linting and formatting configuration
- ✅ Test reporting setup

### **8. Git Configuration**
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for Jenkins artifacts
- ✅ Test reports and coverage exclusions

## 🚀 **Next Steps - What You Need to Do**

### **Immediate Actions (Before Jenkins)**

1. **Install Testing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/raksharane/Documents/ruku/aircraft-engine-monitoring
   pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8
   ```

2. **Run Initial Tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Fix Any Import Issues**
   - Some tests may need path adjustments
   - Verify all imports work correctly

4. **Test Health Checks**
   ```bash
   make health-check
   ```

5. **Commit All Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Jenkins CI/CD infrastructure"
   git push
   ```

### **Jenkins Setup Actions**

1. **Install Jenkins**
   - Install Jenkins on your server/local machine
   - Install required plugins:
     - Pipeline plugin
     - Docker plugin
     - JUnit plugin
     - Git plugin

2. **Create Jenkins Job**
   - Create new Pipeline job
   - Point to your Git repository
   - Use Jenkinsfile from repository

3. **Configure Jenkins Environment**
   - Set up Docker access for Jenkins user
   - Configure Python environment
   - Set up notification channels

4. **Test Pipeline**
   - Run initial pipeline build
   - Fix any environment-specific issues
   - Verify all stages complete successfully

## 📋 **Current Project Status**

### **What's Working**
- ✅ Kafka streaming pipeline
- ✅ PostgreSQL data storage
- ✅ Redis caching
- ✅ Streamlit dashboard
- ✅ ML model training
- ✅ Data simulation

### **What's Ready for Jenkins**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Build automation
- ✅ Environment management
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline definition

### **What Needs Testing**
- ⚠️ Test execution (run tests to identify any issues)
- ⚠️ Model validation tests
- ⚠️ Integration test reliability
- ⚠️ Health check accuracy

## 🎯 **Recommended Testing Workflow**

1. **Run Tests Locally First**
   ```bash
   # Test the Makefile commands
   make install
   make test
   make health-check
   make lint
   ```

2. **Test Docker Integration**
   ```bash
   make docker-test
   make health-check
   make docker-down
   ```

3. **Verify Jenkins Pipeline Locally**
   - Use Jenkins local development tools
   - Test each stage individually

## 🔧 **Configuration Files Created**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/` | Test suite directory |
| `scripts/health_check.py` | System health monitoring |
| `src/config.py` | Environment configuration |
| `Jenkinsfile` | CI/CD pipeline definition |
| `Makefile` | Build automation |
| `pytest.ini` | Test configuration |
| `docker-compose.test.yml` | Test environment |
| `reports/` | Test reports directory |

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Test Dependencies**: Make sure pytest is installed before running tests
2. **Docker Ports**: Test environment uses different ports (5434, 6380) to avoid conflicts
3. **Environment Variables**: Set FLASK_ENV appropriately for different environments
4. **Model Files**: Ensure ML models exist before running model-dependent tests
5. **Service Dependencies**: Some tests require running Docker services

## ✅ **Ready for Jenkins Integration**

Your project is now properly prepared for Jenkins integration with:
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Health monitoring capabilities
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated build processes
- Proper CI/CD pipeline structure

You can now proceed with setting up Jenkins and connecting it to your repository!
